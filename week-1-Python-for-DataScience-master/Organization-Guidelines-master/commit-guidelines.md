# Commit Guidelines

- Please commit the code once every significant change has been made.
- Make the commit messages more clearer and write them so as they represent what has been done.
	- > Eg.,  If you've created a new empty file let the commit message as 
		<br>``` Create filename.extension``` or ```Created filename.extension```
		***Prefer the first form*** 
	- > If you've added a feature to your code let the commit message be
	<br> ```Add feature **feature name**``` or ```Added feature **feature name**```
- Please follow the commit guidelines so as to keep the maintainers life simple.
